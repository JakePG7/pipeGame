# pipeGame
My JFrame CPSC 210 project in all it's glory :) 

This was my first big project with a deeper understanding of OOD, especially with polymorphic structures and design principles.
I was quite proud of my work, I knew in advance that I had shot high so I was diligent on my time management and I was able to make it within the project timeline!

(There is a second repository inside the project folder, it contains project progress)
